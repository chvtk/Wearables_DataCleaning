The Wearables_DataCleaning repo contains:
1.  The R script `run_analysis.R` that contains a series of steps to clean, transform, and summarise the dataset (see `codebook.md` for more information)
2.  `codebook.md`, a codebook that describes the variables, data, and transformations done to produce the final dataset
3.  `Wearables_summary.txt`, a summary file containing the average of each variable for each subject-activity combination.
4.  `readme.md`, a summary of the Wearable_DataCleaning repo.
